#  PeakGuard AI: Intelligent Energy Command Center

**PeakGuard AI** is a state-of-the-art energy forecasting dashboard designed for commercial buildings in India. It uses Machine Learning (LightGBM) to predict electricity demand in real-time, detect contract breaches before they happen, and automate mitigation strategies (Battery Dispatch & HVAC Optimization) to prevent expensive demand penalties.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 1. AI-Powered Forecasting
- Uses **LightGBM** trained on ASHRAE building data to predict load 1 hour in advance.
- Factors in Weather (Temp/Cloud), Time-of-Use (TOU) tariffs, and Building Metadata.

### 🛡️ 2. Interactive Mitigation (Peak Shaving)
- **Manual Mode:** Operators can click to dispatch Battery Storage (50kW) or Optimize HVAC (15% reduction) to fix breaches instantly.
- **🤖 Auto-Pilot Mode:** Autonomous agent detects breaches and executes countermeasures in milliseconds without human intervention.

### 💰 3. Financial Intelligence (Indian Context)
- Real-time tracking of **Rupees Saved (₹)** vs. Grid Penalties.
- Adapts to **Dynamic TOU Tariffs** (Peak Rates vs. Off-Peak Rates).

### 🌱 4. Sustainability Tracking
- Quantifies **Scope 2 Emissions** (Grid Carbon) vs. **Avoided CO₂** via Solar/Battery usage.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Custom CSS, Glassmorphism UI)
- **Backend:** Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **ML Engine:** LightGBM Regressor
- **Visualization:** Altair (Interactive Charts)
